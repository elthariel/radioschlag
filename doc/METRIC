This file describe the use of the 'metric' column found in many tables
of radio schlag.

# Unused
These metric columns are not currently used in the radio schlag code
base :
- metric in audio_file_styles
- metric in audio_file_types

# Audio Files

For each audio file referenced in our db, we are assigning it a
metric, which represents how many time / how often it has been aired
on the radio. Everytime the file is played, the metric column is
incremented by a number defined in scheduler_config.yml:
(audiofile_metric_increment). This metric is therefore used to compute
the probability of a sonf being added in a scheduler playlist to be
effectively played on the radio. This tries to avoid the same tracks
being played again and again, and gives a better impression of random
to the listener.

# Type Styles elements of playlists.

When a playlist is configured in typestyle mode, each type and style
couple is assigned a metric. It represent it's weight when generating
the effective file of list to be played. We adjust the priority of the
tracks of this type and style regarding this metric. If the type and
style couple has a metric of 2.0, the audio files of this type and
style have their initial probability of be played increased by a
factor of 2.
